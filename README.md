## **APP_LABTI-KU**

## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
This application project is based on my scientific paper, in which I developed the Labti-ku application. The app was created to allow students who missed lab sessions to submit memos online, so they no longer need to visit the office in person for memo submission.

## **FILE STRUCTURE**
1. **PortofolioApp_Robby Nugraha.pdf**: This file contains the definition and outcomes of the Labti-ku application.
2. **LABTIku.apk**: This file is the Labti-ku application, which can only be run on an Android platform.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Visual Studio Code**: To code the application development program.
- **Flutter & Dart**: This is the programming language used to create the Labti-ku application.
- **Firebase**: NoSQL database media for creating data from users of the Labti-ku application.
- **PowerPoint**: For presenting result from Labti-ku App.

## **Usage Guide**
- Cloning Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine with the command: `git clone https://github.com/robynhood99/App_Labti-ku.git`
- Open Labti-ku.apk: Open this file and install it. After installation, open the application by entering your username and password if you already have an account. If not, please register first. Then, fill out the form in the memo creation section and press OK to process. Wait for the memo to be generated in Google Drive and for the results to appear.
- View Result: You can view the results in the provided PDF, and you are welcome to study the application for further development.

## **Conclusion**
The results from the application indicate that it runs smoothly without any errors, and the database operates effectively, even though it functions through cloud and NoSQL. For future development, you may improve the application by changing the interface once the memo is completed. Currently, the memo's status (whether it has been created or not) appears only in Google Drive and should ideally be visible within the application. We apologize for not having the original files for the application, as they were accidentally deleted or misplaced while searching for them. Please feel free to start from scratch.
